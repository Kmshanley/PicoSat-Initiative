- Push button schematics are wrong
- Both INA236's have the same address
- PC9543A does not work with 1.8v bus when it is powered with 3.3v
	Replace with PCA9846
- Switch vias to larger size to avoid upcharge
- Switch to LGA footprint for fuel guage, cause the BGA one is too difficult to solder
	Replace with MAX17260, will need current sense resistor
- APS604L one data line was unconnected
- 1.8v I2C busses need lower value resistors
- Connect PDR_ON to VDD to enable voltage supervisor
- Proper design for crystal oscilators
- Connect BOOT0
- Length match OCTOSPI traces
	33 ohm resistors in series with OSPI data lines?
- Length match QSPI traces
- Length match DCMI traces
- SDA and SCL should be roughly the same length
- ESD protection for STLink
- Look into VBAT backup domain for RTC
- Efuse for overcurrent protection
- External Watchdog?
