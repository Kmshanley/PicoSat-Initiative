# PicoSat-Initiative

The Wentworth Picosat initiative is a group at Wentworth Institute of technology dedicated to making a pocket cube satellite capable of earth observation from LEO.

The pocket cube standard requires satellites to be 5x5x5cm and under 250 grams. Upon completion of this Wentworth PicoSat it will become one of the smallest satellites capable of high resolution imagery from LEO.

This repository is divided into two primary sections:
### Test
> Contains all firmware related to testing boards or individual components.
### Flight
> Contains the development for the main flight firmware that will be deployed in space.

Getting Started
------------------------
The easiest way to get started is by using the Stm32CubeIDE.

Downloadable here: https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html

From here you should be able to import the various project files (.ioc) and CubeIDE will handle setup, build tools, and compilation.
